strategy: basic
strength: low

ideas:
- corners are good
- avoid x-squares and c-squares at all costs
- centralization
- maximising disks in sweet 16 (for an 8x8 board)
- fewer surface discs are better
- group discs together in a compact manner

rules:
- never play into x-squares or c-squares, unless given no other choice
- given only the choice of an x-square or a c-square pick the c-square
- minimize surface discs at the start until you have a corner
- flip minimal discs per move
- minimize manhattan distance between your discs
- prioritize flipping discs in the inner side
